# Real Time Face Emotion Detection

This repository contains the code for real-time face emotion detection using libraries and frameworks such as OpenCV, Keras, Tensorflow and PyTorch. The models included in this repository are mainly motivated from papers available on the internet, including ones from paperswithcode.com. All models that are taken from open sources are properly credited in their respective notebook, code or in this README file.

## Models

* Regularized Xception for facial expression recognition with extra training data and step decay learning rate (https://github.com/elangarka/Regularized-Xception-FER-Extra-Training-Data-Step-Decay-Learning-Rate)
(https://paperswithcode.com/paper/regularized-xception-for-facial-expression)


# Usage

Please install the required libraries using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
